1. Started the [Mega Flask Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) by Miguel Grinberg. It's a great tutorial that has you build a web app in Flask. So far I've completed the first 3 lessons. Pushed the files to a project repo on Github at [Microblog](https://github.com/bflatt72/projects/tree/master/microblog)

2. Pushed my blog post creation Python script to github. It can be seen at [BlogInitScript](https://github.com/bflatt72/BlogInitScript). As discussed in previous blog this script automates the process of creating a blog post file in Jekyll. This is a work in progress and I plan on improving it as I learn more. 

3. Created a global gitignore file so that extraneous system and editor files are not pushed to my repos. 

Future projects:

1. Continue and finish the Mega Flask tutorial

2. Create a twitter bot in Python that will auto post my blog posts. 

3. Re-visit my portfolio page and fix the mobile responsiveness. It's not quite right. 

4. Add a couple projects to the placeholder areas on my portfolio. 

5. Continue studying Python

Books I want to buy and work through

1. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python

2. Python Crash Course

3. Python Tricks

4. Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python

School starts again Jan 14. Taking Calc 2 and Computer Science 2, which is Data Structures and Algorithms. God help me!!!

The other evening I got sucked into a 2 hour discussion/argument on Twitter about politics. I have gotten good at mostly ignoring these kinds of things and not participating but every so often I do still find myself sucked into them. Then several hours pass and I realize what a huge time sink it is with absolutely nothing gained from the endeavor. I subsequently deleted all of those tweets of mine because I don't want my Twitter to be political at all. I have strong opinions of my own but by putting my opinions out there in such a public manner, I run the risk of alienating people. That's not smart and not what I want to do. I have carefully curated my Twitter feed to only include educational accounts, science, programming, computer science and web development and as long as I stick to that, Twitter has proven to be a fantastic resource for finding and engaging with amazing people and information. 

Been blown away too with what a fantastic resource Hacker News is. A wealth of great resources are shared there, not just related to esoteric programming subjects but to science and philosophy too. 

One such is a pdf article that was written in 1939 by Abraham Flexner called [The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge](https://library.ias.edu/files/UsefulnessHarpers.pdf) Well worth the read and highly recommended by yours truly. Check it out.
